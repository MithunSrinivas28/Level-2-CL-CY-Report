# Task 1: AWS Lambda

#### What is AWS Lambda and Why is it Used?
AWS lambda is a severless compute service which helps to run the events or a code without a server.The user has to pay for the run time of the event or the application ,this feature helps in scalability and cost cutting. Its a paradigm shift in the field of cloud which helped to manage the servers in a better way.

# Task 2: Intoduction to Jenkins
Jenkins is a Tool which automates the process of building,,testing and deploying the software with a pipeline. It helps to understand the fundamental concept fo Devops known as CI/CD .Jenkins is used to integrate the works and versions of a software seamlessly and provide it to the end users.

![Jenkins Flow 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MithunSrinivas28/level-2-images/main/level%202%20images/jenkins%204.png)

I created a pipeline and wrote the stages for build,test and deploy.The jenkinsfile was used to automate these stages .I ran the pipeline and executed these stages.


# Task 3:SSH

## What is SSH?
SSH is  a cryptographic network protocol for securing and managing access to the remote systems over and unsecured network. In other words, it is a network protocol that is used for transffering the data over the network.

### Learning SSH Commands
"ssh username@hostname" This command is used to connect to a remote server.
SSH is for connecting without using the default port.
`scp` â€“ Copy files to a different computer securely.
- `cat` â€“ View file contents.
- `ls` â€“ List files in a directory.
- `cd` â€“ Change directory.
- `find` â€“ Locate files.
- `du -sh *` â€“ Check file sizes.

 # Bandit overtheiwre

# Task 4: Terraform

## Terraform: What is it?
It is known as  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and is used to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure. It allows users to write declarative configuration files specifying the desired state of infrastructure, and Terraform handles the deployment and changes.
## **Execution of the task**  


I learned how to configure Terraform after installing it.I downloaded the required pluggings using the command `terraform init`.
. After previewing the changes with `terraform plan`, I provisioned the instance using `terraform apply`. After it was successfully executed, I checked the instance's status in the **AWS Management Console** to make sure it worked

###  Key learnings 
- I unserstood The terraform workflow
- I learnt how to create and ec2 instance(I created a ubuntu instance from AIM)
- I understood some of the importnat terraform commands and implemented it

# Task 5: Wireshark

### What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a free open source toll which is used to analyse the data packets in a particular newtork. It is mainly useful for threat detection and controlling traffic in a particular network

### What Did I Do in This Task?
I captured my own Wifi netwrok  and analysed and understood the different ascpets of the captured data with various inbuilt tools in Wireshark Itself
I Filtered out certain protocols like tcp and http and analysed them by plotting graphs and seeing the consevations between ports witht the help of different tools

# Task 8:Web Scraping and Automation - Flight Ticket Price Analysis

In this task, I automated flight searching on Google Flights using Selenium. The process involved opening the website, entering departure and destination cities, selecting travel dates that is bengaluru to hyderabad, and triggering the search. I then extracted flight prices  and saved them in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Intro to dynamic webscraping

The dynamic webscraping includes penetrating thorugh Javascript parts of the websites The selenium libarary used in the task is a dynamic tool whereas the Beautifulsoup used in the previous level is a static webscraper which only reads the HTML.

# Task 9:Hashing
###  What is Hashing?
Hashing is a one way tool which is used to secure passwords and verify them without withdrawing the original data .Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions.

# Task 10:N Map
I got familiar with kali linux and Basic commands of Nmap.I learnt the importance of SSh and the types of penetration testing.I did scanning of of a target ip and found the open ports and their version
